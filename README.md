Personnal side-project. All about first measuring my expenses, second learning some
programming skills/tools.

category usefull to light-up some patterns. Also include a yearly view with a graph and
some interesting value.

## About the author

My name is [Sebastien BARBIER](http://www.sebastienbarbier.com) and I am a web developer. This project is a very long story
for me since I 'worked' on it for a very long period of time now. It was my really first
experience about **Backbone** and **Django REST Framework**, made multiple prototype and 
endided up with taht version.

For the anegdote, the name of this project (723e) come from the fact at the time I needed it, my monthly
salary was exactly 723 euros. I was freelance, tought time but god I loved it.

Thanks for reading, I hope my small contribution might help you in any way whatsoever :D
