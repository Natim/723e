723e
====

Personal side-project. All about measuring my daily expenses, but also learning some
programming skills/tools.

Features
--------

First version is all about simplicity. Monthly view of your expenses, related to a
category usefull to light-up some patterns. Also include a yearly view with a graph and
some interesting value. Then classic settings page. That's it.

`http://723e.readthedocs.org <http://723e.readthedocs.org>`_, but don't expect much, it is 
almost empty for know. (Ouuuh that is really bad). I hope it will come soon, but I know this is critical to make
this project usable.

About the author
----------------

My name is `Sebastien BARBIER <http://www.sebastienbarbier.com>`_ and I am a web developer. This project has been a long story
for me since I 'worked' on it for so long. It was my really first
experience about **Backbone** and **Django REST Framework**, made multiple prototype and 
failed quite a lot. I learned from my mistake, no doubts about that.

For the anecdote, the name of this project (723e) come from the fact at the time I needed it, my monthly
salary was exactly 723(.3) euros. I was freelance, tough time, but gosh I loved it.

Thanks for reading, I hope my small contribution might help you in any way whatsoever :D
