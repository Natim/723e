Models and api
==============

By default, your server instance deploy locally a swagger and redoc instance accessible threw the ``/swagger/`` and ``/redoc/`` urls. Those are code generated, and provide tools to describe and test available ressources.


You can also access the public instance on the seven23.io server:

- `Official swagger instance <https://seven23.io/swagger/>`_
- `Official redoc instance <https://seven23.io/redoc/>`_
