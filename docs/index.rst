Welcome to 723e's documentation!
================================

Thanks for trying to access this documentation, it means you shown interest in this project.

About 723e
----------

This is a **personal side-project**. All about measuring my daily expenses, but also learning some
programming skills/tools.

First version is all about simplicity. Monthly view of your expenses, related to a
category usefull to light-up some patterns. Also include a yearly view with a graph and
some interesting value. Then classic settings page. That's it.

I apologize for the terrible code quality. When first release will come I'll spend time refactoring, documenting, and testing. For now, I barely satisfy first few features.

*NDLR : This projet is in development since few years now, going very slowly.
Had some interesting evolution in July 2015, might expect a first realease around September 2015.*


About the author
----------------

My name is `Sebastien BARBIER <http://www.sebastienbarbier.com>`_ and I am a web developer. This project has been a long story for me since I 'worked' on it for so long. It was my really first
experience about **Backbone** and **Django REST Framework**, made multiple prototype and 
failed quite a lot. I learned from my mistake, no doubts about that.

For the anecdote, the name of this project (723e) come from the fact at the time I needed it, my monthly
salary was exactly 723 euros. I was freelance, tough time, but gosh I loved it.

Thanks for reading, I hope my small contribution might help you in any way whatsoever :D
